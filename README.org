# Genetic Algorithm in JavaScript

From [[http://www.meetup.com/West-London-Hack-Night/][West London Hack Night]] 11/7/2013, this is a genetic algorithm
that creates a pool of random strings, and sees if evolution will draw
that pool towards an ideal target string.

The code is exactly as written after about 1hr 20m of hacking, so
you'll have to excuse all the obvious rough edges. That said, it
accomplishes its aim, and shows that you can cut your teeth on a
genetic algorithm in an evening.
