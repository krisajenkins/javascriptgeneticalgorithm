* Genetic Algorithm in JavaScript

From [[http://www.meetup.com/West-London-Hack-Night/][West London Hack Night]] 11th July 2013, this is a genetic
algorithm that creates a pool of random strings, and sees if evolution
will draw that pool towards an ideal target.

The code is exactly as written after about 1hr 20m of hacking, so
you'll have to excuse all the obvious rough edges. That said, it
accomplishes its aim, and shows that you can cut your teeth on a
genetic algorithm in an evening.
